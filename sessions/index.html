    <div>
        <p>SESSION 1-4/21-Escape from Tower: Everyone eventually escaped their pods, and out of a window from the (5 story)  Wizard's tower. "GALISH" was the only name found that could identify this human man in a robe. (Wizard?) Also found a book labeled "how to become a god."  Met TORG the half ogre (who seemed to be the caretaker of a large graveyard next to the tower).  Met TRAPPS. Fought two FLESH GOLLUMS, and escaped through the sewers. Trapps says he cannot 'smell a soul on any of them.'  Trapps gives the group 1 Compass and 1 Map of Farune. *Had Shrimp Scampi.
        </p>
        <p>SESSION 2-5/5-VISITING SECOMBER: Camped overnight- no encounters. Teleported by Trapps to SECOMBER (5 miles away). Went to GREEN GOAT inn. Found armorer and weapons shop (TINY AND SCAR) Met random Mage who detected aligment before coming into town. Acquired  kobold named DEDRICK from Mage in shop. Battled 9 UNDEAD GOBLINS + 3 CULTISTS. Founds HOLY SYMBOL on cultists (not sure its meaning). Discovered that since the players have no souls, * NO RESURRECTION POSSIBLE.
    </p>
    <p>SESSION 3- 5/12-GOING TO A CLUB: The following night, everyone goes to a club "THE PINK UNICORN." Trapps Tells them of an artifact he needs from PERCIVAL. Everyone defeats 3 OGRES, 'CEDRIC' MAGE. More Holy symbols. Percival tells them where to find the cave where the artifact is located. Remus visits CHURCH OF HELM. Discovers he needs to go either to FONT OF KNOWLEGE IN WATERDEEP or CANDELKEEP to find answers. Obtained diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>SESSION 4-5/19-VISITING CAVE: The next day everyone goes to the cave to find the artifact. 2 DARK MANTLES, 1 GIBBERING MOUTHER, 2 CULTISTS, 1 MAGE, 1 VOSKE DEMON. Someone finds a book which is in Infernal (Can't decipher) Everyone meets DOBSON THE WIZARD (Trapps' Friend.) Everyone receives 1 uncommon magic item for cookies. Everyone learns they are actually CLONES tethered to their original selves. If original dies, their body gets taken over and PC die.
    </p>
    <p>SESSION 5-6/2-GROUNDHOG DAY: 3 options presented to players going forward. 1) Kill their original selves taking there place.... ((kinda evil)). 2) Attempt to obtain a 'Devine Spark' and become a God to get a soul. ((Very difficult)). 3) Discover some kind of 'reverse spell' to combine the memories and bodies of the cloned players and their original selves. ((This means discovering the history of the spell- the who what where when and why- and going on a quest to find someone who can 'fix' it.)) So, to get the group 'more powerful' Traps sends the party to Falkovia in Ravenloft. Everyones alignment turns evil, and the group must discover why the domaine of Falkovia explodes after 20 minutes. Defeated 2 WRAITHS. Vladeska turns into Oni, but everyone dies from the Shadowfell monsters swarming the village.
    </p>
    <p>SESSION 6- 6/30- GROUNDHOG DAY 2: The Shadowfell swarm is let in (Zombie and shadow demons) When the town is alive, the players get all the artifacts and solve the shield alter puzzle, releasing Vladeska- not killing her. Adventurers go to Dobsons for the night and sent on the road to Candelkeep the next day. On the road, they find 4 HANDS OF JERGAL. ( LEVEL 6!)
    </p>
    <p>SESSION 7-7/7-ROAD TO CANDELKEEP: 4 HAND OF JERGAL defeated. Met Torg again. Convened to go kill Ogres in a cave. Find ruins of old Asmodeus worshipping temple. Lots of demon summoning stuff- books- potions- large metal door. 2 SLUG ORGRES. (Found: 1 blue potion- invisibly, 2 pink, 1 yellow- feather fall, 2 purple. 1 book 'the horrors of Falkovia,'  1 book 'how to speak Infernal.â€™)
    </p> 
    <p>SESSION 8- 7/21-"THE ASHMADAI":  2 SLUG OGRES, 1 MIMIC. Trixie gets a 'magic lock pick.' Everyone goes to Cloakwood Inn/Tavern to rest for the night. The group discovers they need 'books (or works of writing) that Candelkeep doesn't have to get into Candelkeep.' Trapps arrives that night, beaten from 'taking care of Vladeska.'  Passes out, healed by Ramus. In the morning, Ashmadai attacks and clasps some cuff of magic inhibition onto Trapps. (It burns) 7 ASHMADAI. Group fights, Trixie releases Traps, and four die, but three run. We learn that the Ashmadai are most likely trying to capture Trapps.
    </p>
    <p>SESSION 9 - 7/27- TRUTH OR DRINK: Ramus, Zed, Robert, and Trixie all play a rousing game of Truth or Drink, where the participants have to answer questions about their past... or lie... but if caught lying, they must take a shot. Three shots total, and the PC passes out. Robert passed out and floated to the ceiling.  The next day, the 4 meet a Dwarf, "Radgast," who is trying to steal from them using his 4 trained ferrets. He explains that he is trying to get more money in order to rescue the Circus animals  he was transporting to Waterdeep. A band of Orcs had stolen them from him a day ago (2 bears, 1 dire wolf, 1 fox, 1 spider, and 1 baby Owlbear), and if he doesn't pay the ransom of 2000 gp, then he'll never get them back. The 4 go to find the Orcs, discover the cave, kill 3 ORCS-
